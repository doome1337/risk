Gantt Chart:
Main things to be coded:
-Basic struct classes:  //BASICALLY DONE
	This must be done basically before main game logic
	Applicable classes:
	risk.game.Army
	risk.game.Unit
	risk.gameMap
	risk.gameCountry
-Sprite creation:  //Time: unknown.  Anyone want to do this?  shouldnâ€™t take too long
	Should be done fairly soon to help with adding rendering features etc.
	Sprites needed:
	Unit sprites
	Button sprites (e.g. for moving, attacking, etc.)
	
	
-Rendering:
	-This can be done over time, adding rendering features as their logic counterparts are added
	Applicable classes:
	risk.Rendering
-Game Logic: 
	Main part that needs to be coded, including main game loop, etc.

-Final touchups/testing etc: we should leave the last at least 4-5 days for this
